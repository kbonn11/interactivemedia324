      <p>"This is the loading dock on which I got drunk on the evening of Fidget where I went with my dog and a bottle of Jack Daniels and sat down at about 6pm I began drinking I was wearing dark sunglasses in this decrepit loading dock facing an office block and I recorded every move as I was swigging down the Jack Daniels I must have looked like a crazy bum sitting here and talking to myself for two and half hours I was getting more drunk and I was slurring my words then I walked west down the street to the river kept talking and doing my activity looking over the Hudson River before the tape recorder clicked itself off this is an important site for Fidget on june 16 1997 the loading dock is still as grubby and awful as on that day and the tape recorder just clicked off</p>
      <p> Where we're standing was a cafeteria called the Daynton Cafeteria and when I first came to New York there were still old Jewish places that were open all night for garment workers and people packing lofts down here artists would come and sit forever in this place and have a cup of coffee and crummy Jewish food it always used to be full the garment district it's all gone now in the 80s it became a restaurant called Amsterdams they just gutted the Daynton and then that went out because it was pretty horrible and then this clothes store moved in and to save money they just took off the S and called it Amsterdam and I just love the way NY fills up its history they just don't take things down it's just typical in a wonderful way NY keeps on accumulating its history over and over again and look only the AMSTER is still there and the DAM is unlit and this is all falling apart</p>
      <p> Where we are now used to be a dog run where dogs can go and be free I had a dog in the early 90s late 80s when I had an office in the Cable Building and it's in this dog run that I read all the works of Modernism most specifically I remember reading Ulysses in this part of the dog run I completely educated myself to everything Modernist I'd never paid much attention to it before but now I read everything I could get my hands on and also the complete works of Henry James and Washington Square of course I read Making of Americans here I read Cummings here I read the Cantos right in this dog run it was insanely important for my Modernist education I just sat down and read everything" </p>
